# Chess
Chess is almost fully implemented) 
There are several rules that have not been fully implemented. 
Such as the:
1.When a pawn becomes 8 or 1 square, it automatically becomes a Queen 
(there is no option to select a piece)
2.When a pawn crosses the attacked space - there is no option for the 
opponent to take it or leave it.
3.Everything else is fully implemented.
- Correct movement of all figures
- Castling
- Check for check
- And so on ...))
